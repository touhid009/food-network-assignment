            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id="about-me-paragraph">I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life,
                cooking dinner usually
                meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t
                until I got married that I started eating real food because I married a guy who cooks. I started joining
                him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun. Eating real food was really fun. And gaining
                confidence as chef? That was life changing! I have a passion for cooking and a huge desire to show that
                living a healthy lifestyle can actually be easy and fun! </p><br><br>
